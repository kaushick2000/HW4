PROBLEM 0 

Implement the Fibonacci sequence

x = fib(n)

    if n == 0

        return 0

    if n == 1

         return 1

    return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)

Debug the code and "step into" the function for fib(5). I want you to step into all recursive calls and list out the the function call stack ex. fib(5) -> fib(4) -> fib(3) ?....  that you observe.

Note, don't turn on optimization if your programming language allows it.

Another note make sure to implement the return exactly as

return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2) instead of say

a = fib(n-1)

b = fib(n-2)

return a + b

OR as

return fib(n-2) + fib(n-1)

The reason is, I want everyone to have similar results.
**ans:** 
1) implementation refer to fibo.py file
2) For explaination refer to fib_doc file

For the following two problems:

1. Implement the solutions and upload it to github

2. Prove the time complexity of the algorithms

3. Comment on way's you could improve your implementation (you don't need to do it just discuss it)

PROBLEM 1 : 
Examples: 

Input: K = 3, N =  4
array1 = [1,3,5,7]
array2 = [2,4,6,8]
array3 = [0,9,10,11]
Output: [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11]
Merged array in a sorted order where every element is greater than the previous element.

Input: K = 3, N =  3
array1 = [1,3,7]
array2 = [2,4,8]
array3 = [9,10,11]
Output: [1,2,3,4,7,8,9,10,11]
Merged array in a sorted order where every element is greater than the previous element.

**ANS:** 

refer to the file merge_sort_array1.py file 

TIME COMPLEXITIY ANALYSIS: 
 the time complexity is O(n1+n2)
POTENTIAL IMPROVEMENTS: 
Using a Min-Heap 
Two-Pointer Technique with K-way Merge
Batch Processing

Problem 2

Given a sorted array array of size N, the task is to remove the duplicate elements from the array.

Examples: 

Input: array = [2, 2, 2, 2, 2]
Output: array= [2]
Explanation: All the elements are 2, So only keep one instance of 2.

Input: array = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5, 5]
Output: array[] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

Note, you can't use something like the set container in C++.

**ANS** 
refer to the file remove_duplicates.py 

TIME COMPLEXITIY ANALYSIS: 
It is O(N)
